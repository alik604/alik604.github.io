mySite


## i just learned how to make a github.io page after look at someone elses page: https://github.com/gajalchouhan/gajalchouhan.github.io
when i "need" to make the page, ill use bootstrap and hopefully get the whole thing done in one day. 

ill have a one page site. it will be a TL;DR about me, my top projects with screenshot + explanation, finally on bottom, my resume (which ill no doubt be too lazy to update LOL).
