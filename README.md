## Personal Projects 
- Machine learning and quantitative analytics (Present)
All Notes can be found on my GitHub
- Time series prediction and algorithmic trading. I’m adding a technical indictor to my stock watchlist
and simulator application. I am using TensorFlow, Keras and Flask.
- 99.24% accuracy on MNIST, a data set of recognizing hand-written digits.
- Multivariate human behavior models to predict if my boss will take the team out for lunch on a given
week.
- Anomaly detection in time series, and human behavior, using classical statistical methods (Bayesian
inference) and recurrent neural networks
- C++ low-level (05/2018 –09/201 9 )
    - DLL Injection malware. Efficient and multithreaded to finish core tasks before detection
    - System information detector,
    - Code review on C++ microcontroller code for the SFU Robot soccer club
- SFU Robot soccer club (05/2018 – 12/2018)
    - I volunteered to build a website to replace the existing _SquareSpace_ based one. This saves the club
       about $150 a year. Hosted on _sfuskynet.ca_
- Stock watchlist and simulator (05/2018 – 08/2018)
    - Used MERN stack for the core, along with bcrypt, passport, and JWT to support secure log-in
    - This app allows me to analyze N number of stocks at a time, with 2 graphs per stocks, this resulted in
       me going through my watchlist about 30% faster
- Multiple Android apps (08/2017 – 05/2018)
    - ‘Quick mental math’ app is a simple app which revolves around TextView and EditText
    - ‘Calculator’ app is an iOS style calculator which was my first serious android app.
- Programming 11 and 12 projects ( 04 /201 4 - 05 /201 5 )
    - Media player made with JavaFX, Scientific calculator made with Swing and AWT. Dec 2015 code sample

  - Optimized 30 firewalls across North America. Lead the project and held meetings with managers
  - Conducted inventories of Internet facing assets with NMAP and Nessus.
  - Assisted in patching or removing vulnerable software using Group Policy, PowerShell, and Python
  - Wrote training documents covering the above topics and the _SANS FOR508_ course
  - Assisted in (network) penetration testing, and threat hunting, the searching of malicious software or
     intrusion, on all accessible endpoints and servers.
- Phone-ER, Cell phone repair technician (06/2015 – 04/2019)
- Evergreen Computers, Volunteer as Computer repair technician (06/2014 – 07/
